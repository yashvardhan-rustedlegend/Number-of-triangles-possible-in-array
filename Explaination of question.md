# Number-of-triangles-possible-in-array
Given an unsorted array of positive integers, find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles. For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any of the two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side).
Examples:

Input: arr= {4, 6, 3, 7}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three triangles 
possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. 
Note that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle.
